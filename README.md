## Update
project-7 created by GitHub Classroom

This is an android inventory management application. To run this prototype you need Android Studio. In the inventory management app we have three different functions. The dashboard shows the amount of stock you have for each product and alerts in red if product is running low, for example less than 50. The orders section show the current number of pending orders, current orders and upcoming orders. The scanner section brings up a scanner that will have the ability to scan inventory.

For the updated prototype, we added some features, including a recent activity button for every item and color coded  each item to indicate if they were moveable or non-moveable.
